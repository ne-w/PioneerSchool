    <h3>
        WHAT WE STAND ON
    </h3>

    <p>
        BE UNUSUALLY BRAVE
        
        As an AET academy, we choose to be unusually brave.   We’re not afraid to challenge wrongs, to make the right call, even when it’s both unusual and difficult to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
        DISCOVER WHAT’S POSSIBLE
        
        We are on the search for discovering what’s possible.  At Pioneer School we look to create “wow moments” for our pupils, helping them discover a world of possibilities and opportunities.
    </p>

    <p>
        PUSH THE LIMITS
        
        We always strive to push the limits.  We don’t settle for less than excellent and we won’t allow our pupils to either.  We resolve to overcome any self-imposed limits.
    </p>

    <p>
        BE BIG-HEARTED
        
        At Pioneer School we commit to being big-hearted.  We choose to treat each other with kindness, warmth and care, believing that everybody matters and believing in one another.
